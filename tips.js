const ODETES_TIPS = {
    basic: [
        "Use 'a' before words starting with a consonant sound (a car) and 'an' before a vowel sound (an apple).",
        "For simple present questions, start with 'Do you...?' (Do you like coffee?) or 'Does he/she...?' (Does she work here?).",
        "Remember the verb 'to be': I am, you are, he/she/it is, we are, they are.",
        "The past tense of many regular verbs ends in '-ed', like 'walk' -> 'walked'.",
        "Use 'in' for cities and countries (in Brazil), 'on' for streets (on Paulista Avenue), and 'at' for specific addresses (at 123 Main Street).",
        "Always capitalize the word 'I' when talking about yourself.",
        "'There is' is for a single item (There is a book on the table), and 'There are' is for multiple items (There are two chairs).",
        "To make a sentence negative in the simple present, use 'don't' or 'doesn't'. (I don't know. He doesn't agree).",
        "Practice common irregular verbs like go -> went, see -> saw, and eat -> ate.",
        "When asking 'how much', you want to know the price or a quantity you can't count. 'How many' is for things you can count.",

    ],
    intermediate: [
        "Try to use phrasal verbs to sound more natural. For example, instead of 'discover', say 'find out'.",
        "Expand your vocabulary by learning synonyms. Instead of always saying 'good', try 'excellent', 'fantastic', or 'wonderful'.",
        "Use 'used to' to talk about past habits that you don't do anymore. 'I used to play the guitar.'",
        "The Present Perfect ('I have seen that movie') connects the past to the present. It's great for life experiences.",
        "Vary your connectors. Instead of just 'and' or 'but', try using 'however', 'although', or 'moreover'.",
        "The first conditional ('If it rains, I will take an umbrella') is used for real future possibilities.",
        "The second conditional ('If I had a million dollars, I would travel') is for hypothetical or imaginary situations.",
        "Pay attention to prepositions after adjectives and verbs, like 'interested in', 'good at', or 'listen to'.",
        "Instead of 'very tired', you could say 'exhausted'. Instead of 'very big', try 'huge' or 'enormous'.",
        "Gerunds (-ing form) can act as the subject of a sentence: 'Swimming is my favorite hobby.'",
        "Practice the difference between 'for' (a period of time) and 'since' (a specific point in time). 'I have lived here for three years.' vs 'I have lived here since 2022.'"
    ],
    advanced: [
        "Incorporate idiomatic expressions into your speech. For example, 'bite the bullet' means to face a difficult situation with courage.",
        "Use the passive voice to change the focus of a sentence. 'The report was written by the team' focuses on the report, not the team.",
        "To express nuanced opinions, use phrases like 'I'm inclined to believe that...' or 'From my perspective...'.",
        "Master inversion for emphasis and formal language: 'Never have I seen such a beautiful sunset.' instead of 'I have never seen...'.",
        "Use cleft sentences to emphasize a specific part of a statement: 'It was the manager who made the final decision.'",
        "Learn subtle differences between words, like 'affect' (verb) and 'effect' (noun), or 'historic' (important in history) and 'historical' (related to history).",
        "To sound more persuasive, use rhetorical questions in discussions: 'Wouldn't it be better if we tried another approach?'",
        "Pay attention to collocations - words that naturally go together, like 'make a decision' (not 'do a decision') or 'heavy rain'.",
        "Experiment with using participle clauses to make your sentences more concise: 'Feeling tired, he went to bed early.'",
        "For complex ideas, use advanced connectors like 'nonetheless', 'consequently', and 'whereas' to show clear relationships between clauses.",
        "Practice using modals of deduction for past events, like 'He must have missed the train' (certainty) or 'She might have forgotten' (possibility)."
